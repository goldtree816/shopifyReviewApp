# Shopify App Template - React Router

This is a template for building a [Shopify app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started) using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/). It was forked from the [Shopify Remix app template](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix) and converted to React Router.

Rather than cloning this repo, follow the [Quick Start steps](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-react-router#quick-start).

Visit the [`shopify.dev` documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-app-react-router) for more details on the React Router app package.
